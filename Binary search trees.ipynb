    "## Binary Search Tree (BST) \n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child, and the topmost node in the tree is called the root. It additionally satisfies the binary search property, which states that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the left subtree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search trees allow fast lookup, addition, and removal of items. They keep their keys in sorted order so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search: when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, based on the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree so that each lookup, insertion, or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables."
